Here are projects I've worked on for my web design class.

## My personal webpage, my first project

- http://eve.kean.edu/~andradga/TECH3500/project1/index.html

- <b>Description:</b> This was the first website I really designed, and it is my personal webpage. It contains things like my career/job experience, personal information about me, and contact information to get in touch with me.


## The Better Company, my second project

- http://eve.kean.edu/~andradga/project2/index.html

- <b>Description:</b> This was my second project, where I designed a website for a fake company that I called "The Better Company", the premise of which is that it is a company that claims it can do anything better than any other business you might have in mind. I designed a few different pages for it which include fake contact information, "services" it offers, and the executives running the project (they are real people but unfortunately have nothing to do with this project's creation).


## Redesigning my University's web registration website, the final project

- http://eve.kean.edu/~andradga/finalproject/index.html

- <b>Description:</b>  Last but not least, we have my final project, which was a Web Dev story where I attempted to redesign my University's (Kean University) web registration website (webreg.kean.edu), which looks very poorly designed and was in need of a makeover and improvements. The project aimed to make the website more mobile-friendly, user-friendly, give it a better UI and design, and overall make it more useable and easier to navigate, by keeping Design Thinking in mind and applying that to designing the page all over again.
